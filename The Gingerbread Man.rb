The Gingerbread Man

once upon a time there lived an old couple in an old small shack next to a
forest they were living a happy and peaceful life their only regret was not having a
child of their own one day when the old lady was making cookie dough in the kitchen her husband
came in.
darling what are you cooking today 
oh my darling i'm baking a gingerbread
man today the old lady knead the dough and cut a
gingerbread man shape after putting it in the oven she sat down and started to wait for the
gingerbread man to bake when she could smell the delicious
cookie all around the air in the kitchen she put on her oven gloves and took the gingerbread man out
now it was time to decorate it she made eyes out of raisins
and a cute nose using candy and then she used some cream to make his
hair and clothes and lastly she used cherries to make some buttons for him
she had to look at her masterpiece and said my gingerbread man looks beautiful
but i feel like something is missing the old lady looked at him again and oh
his mouth i forgot to make his mouth she drew a mouth on the gingerbread man's face with
the cream oh yes now you are complete my gingerbread man
at that moment something unexpected happened thank you but but how can it be you are talking
gingerbread man suddenly stood up and started running yeah and i can also run
the gingerbread man jumped from the kitchen bench to the chair then to the ground and started running fast to the
kitchen door to the garden 
come back the old lady yelled
 the gingerbread man began talking whilst
he was running yeah run run as fast as you can but nobody can catch me because i'm the
gingerbread man the old lady got out to the garden and started running after the gingerbread
man the man looked out the window and saw his wife running and yelled hey
where are you running the old lady answered to her husband whilst running
my gingerbread man ran away i'm trying to catch him
the old man was speechless the old lady
ran but the gingerbread man was so fast that it was impossible to catch him after a short while the gingerbread man
came across a ranch a grazing cow noticed him
ah what a nice cookie i should cut and eat him the cow also began to run after the
gingerbread man wait don't run i'm gonna eat ya yeah run run as fast as you can
and old ladies also trying to catch me but nobody can because i'm the gingerbread man
the old lady and the cow were running after the gingerbread man
and at this time a pig noticed the gingerbread man 
a gingerbread man true to my tastebuds wait and i will catch you
the gingerbread man answered the pig whilst he was running yeah run run as
fast as you can an old lady and a cow are also trying to catch me but nobody care because i'm the
gingerbread man while they were running the gingerbread man in front the old lady cow and the
pink behind him a chicken noticed the gingerbread man while looking for some food
that has to be my lunch so the chicken tagged along rum as much
as you want gingerbread man i'm gonna cut you yeah run run as fast as you can an old
lady a cow and a pig could not catch me neither can you nobody can because i'm
the gingerbread man the gingerbread man in front the old lady cow the pig and the chicken they
all continued to run but the gingerbread man was getting more and more further ahead from the others
the gingerbread man was so happy and very proud of himself i'm the brightest
and the fastest gingerbread man in the world yes that's me
nobody can catch me because i'm the gingerbread man
when he looked ahead soon the tutor bad man saw that he was coming across a river
and he stopped because he knew that water could make him melt away
on oh what now the old lady cow pig and the chicken
were close now right at that moment a shifty fox appeared from behind a tree
i know how to swim if you want i can help you the gingerbread man thought about it
what if you eat me you don't have to worry i don't want to eat you i just want to help you get
across the gingerbread man trusted the shifty fox and jumped on his tail holding on as tight as he could the fox
jumped in the river and began to swim meanwhile the old lady cow pig and the
chicken came to the edge of the river and saw the gingerbread man crossing the river on the back of a fox
helplessly they watched them go knowing they could not catch him anymore
the river began to get deeper and the waters start to rise hey fox keep your
tail up i almost got wet up on my back it's safer
the gingerbread man hopped on the fox's back they swam for a while but as the water got deeper the fox's back began to
sink in the water i'm afraid that you'll get wet why don't
you jump on my head where it's a bit higher the gingerbread man climbed up on his
head the fox continued to pursue his plan and dipped his head down in the water
the water has risen too much why don't you get on my nose it's higher
so the gingerbread man got on top of his nose right when they were about to reach the shore the fox dipped his nose
flipping the gingerbread man into the air and opened his mouth the gingerbread man was going to fall into his mouth and
the fox was going to eat him but it didn't work while the gingerbread
man was in the air a crow flying right above them caught the gingerbread man with his beak
the fox just stood there looking with his mouth open the gingerbread man waited for the crow
to fly a little further and asked do crows eat ginger cookies
yep when the crow opened his beak to speak the gingerbread man fell down and began to run as fast as he could
yeah run run as fast as you can an old lady a cow a pig a chicken a fox and a crow
also trying to catch me but nobody can because i'm the gingerbread man
the gingerbread man kept on running and did not stop 
if you see a gingerbread man pass you by running do not try to catch him
because he is the gingerbread man and nobody can dare catch him.
