once upon a time the animals in a farm
were left with no food
the little red hen decided to wander
around the field to look for something
to eat

she first went next to the cow
will you come with me around the field to find something to eat
no i won't it's too hot i can't be bothered to walk

she then went next to the pig
will you help me find food
no i can't calm
it's too hot and i can't be bothered to move 
later then went next to the dog
will you help me find food no i can't
it's too hot and i can't walk when it's hot

and in the end went next to the duck will you come with me to find something to eat 
no i can't it's too hot i can't get out of the water


when nobody bothered to come with her
the hen decided to leave the farm on her
own
as she walked she found some wheat
grains on the ground


she was very happy
she returned to the farm
she decided to plant the wheat grains
she thought that her friends would help her

cow look i found wheat grains would you like to plant them with me
no i already told you it's too hot
the hen went over to the pig
big look i found wheatgrains would you
like to plant them with me
no i can't the weather is way too hot
for this
she then went next to the dog
dog look i found weak grains would you
like to plant them with me
no it's way too hot
and at last she went next to the duck
hey doc i found some wheatgrains would
you like to plant them with me
not okay i can't leave the water in this
heat
well i'll plant them myself
when she saw that no one wanted to help
her
she decided to plant them herself
weeks had gone by
the rainy days had begun the seeds had
sprouted
but all the wild grass in the garden
needed some cleaning
who's going to help me clean the grass
it's too muddy now i can't help you i'm
not up to it i won't leave my spot
i'll get dirty can't do it don't feel
good today i can't help
in that case i'll do it on my own
the little red hen began to clean the
wild grass amongst the sprouts
not long after the wheat began to grow
it was now time to harvest the ripe
wheat
the hen went next to her friends and
asked if they would help her harvest the
crop hey cow buddy
wheat has grown will you help me harvest
the crop no i can't
hey pig guess what the wheat has grown
will you help me harvest the crop
no i can't i won't
hey my buddy dog the wheat has grown
will you come and help me harvest the
crop who me of course not hey ducky
ducky the wheat is grown will you help
me harvest the crop of course i can't
okay i'll do it on my own
the little red hen worked till night
time
she harvested the wheat kernels one by
one all by herself

it was now time to turn the wheat to
flour
off she went to ask for help from her
friends hey guys
we must grind the wheat to make flour
who would like to help me
i can't help it's time for me to give
milk i can't move from my sport

i can't help peter it's snap time for me
i can't help at all
can't help me to get into the water and
cool down
the hen ground the wheat in the mill and
turned it into flour now let's make some
delicious bread
the hen went next to her friends and
wanted to give them one last chance
cow i'm going to make bread would you
like to help me nope i can't i'm in no
situation to work
what about you pig
not today i'm too tired to have today
no no i can't no i can't and besides i
don't know how to make bread
this time the hen was very angry
all by herself she went to the kitchen
first she made bread with the flour she
had grounded
then she gave it a form
and at last
put it in the oven and waited for it to
bake
after the amazing smell of the bread had
spread
she took it out of the oven
went out to the garden and sat on the
table
later
called out to her friends
hey guys the bread is ready who would
like to eat it with me
seeing the amazing bread in front of the
hen in a flash they all went next to her

no i want
oh me too
right when i'm so
hungry
great timing hen
hey me too hen i love bread come on
let's eat
no i can't i can't
i did everything on my own only i
deserve to eat it all on my own

with great appetite the hen began to eat
her bread
but couldn't handle the fact that her
friends were so hungry
from now on if you promise to help
i will share my bread with you
all the farmyard animals were ashamed
and sorry
they knew she was right
we promise you
this
the hen knew her friends learnt a good
lesson
so she shared her bread with them
an amazing appetite they were now so
happy
with a full tummy
